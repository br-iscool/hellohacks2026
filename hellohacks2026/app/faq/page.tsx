		question: "What is Findr?",
		answer: "Findr is a student-facing discovery page that brings UBC club activities into one searchable place. It is a hackathon prototype using sample event and club listings.",
	},
	{
		question: "Where do event details come from?",
		answer: "The product concept is to organize public announcements shared by UBC clubs and link back to the organizer’s original post. The listings in this demo are placeholders and are not connected to Instagram or a database.",
	},
	{
		question: "How do I find something to do?",
		answer: "Search by event, club, or place; choose a category; or use the calendar to browse a week or month. Select a calendar event to see its details.",
	},
	{
		question: "Are the dates and locations current?",
		answer: "No. The dates, times, locations, prices, club names, and descriptions shown here are mock data for the hackathon presentation. Confirm details with an event organizer before attending.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can clubs submit or update events?",
		answer: "Submission and account tools are not implemented in this prototype. The clubs page currently demonstrates how club profiles and Instagram links could appear.",
